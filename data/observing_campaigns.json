    "Abstract": "This Observing Campaign consists of two primary projects. The first part is a FUSE (Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer) cataclysmic variable survey, which aims to observe cataclysmic variables with the orbiting FUSE observatory to help schedule the FUSE observing time and to obtain time series optical data simultaneously with the FUSE observations for correlation of the optical and ultraviolet data. The second project is a preliminary observing campaign centered around NGC 6811 in September 2006, with the goal of looking for new variable stars and possible exoplanet transits which will ultimately be observed by the NASA Kepler Discovery Space Mission.",
    "Justification": "The project helps in scheduling the FUSE observational time and capture data of cataclysmic variables. Discovering new star variables and possible exoplanet transits will not only expand our knowledge of astronomy but also aids the NASA Kepler mission.",

TT Ari exibits superhumps - both positive (the superhump period is longer than the orbital period) and negative (the superhump period is shorter than the orbital period). While positive superhumps are thought probably to be the result of an eccentric configuration in the accretion disk, the mechanism for negative superhumps is not yet understood.

There is reportedly a coherent phenomenon of pulsation occurring at roughly 1/3 of the 27.1-year orbital period which may have already begun.

The period of Mira variation is 387.0 days; the eclipse period is 43.6-44 years.

The system displays both negative (shorter than orbital period) and positive (longer than orbital period) superhumps.

    "Justification": "Dr. Pala writes: 'We know that some observers carry out time-series observations and also spectroscopy, and we welcome any additional contributions. Nonetheless the monitoring to assess quiescence should have the highest priority since, without it, there is the risk to lose the allocated orbits. In case of time-series observations, an uninterrupted light curve in a single filter (preferably B or V) would be better than alternating with different filters. CV observations can still be useful but V-filter observations should be the priority (whenever possible). DSLR observations, particularly if they are transformed to V, will be useful and are welcome. Visual observations will also be very valuable.'",

The Hα emission was fairly consistent in observations from DDO and DAO in 1996 and 1997 as well as in spectra taken from WIRO in 2013 and 2014; the variability was minimal over timescales ranging from hours to years. This long-lived emission contrasts with well- studied emission from the Oe star ζ Oph where emission is more episodic. The most recent observations for VES 735 came in 2021 and 2022 from the DAO and Apache Point Observatory which showed the intensity of the Hα emission between 2 - 4 times the level of the stellar continuum. This is in strong contrast to the 1.1 - 1.5 times the continuum level that had been seen in the observations between 1996 and 2014. The goal is to arrange photometric observations to complement a new spectroscopic campaign at DAO this fall that determines if the emission has returned to its pre-outburst state or if the strong emission is still ongoing. The AAVSO observing campaign observations will allow us to see if there is a relationship between the star’s Hα brightness and the star’s V-band magnitude.",

    "Abstract": "Observations of the magnetic cataclysmic variable V1082 Sgr have been scheduled with the Hubble Space Telescope. Any photometric data you can obtain in the next nights, particularly on the night of August 9th and 10th, would be extremely helpful to understand if the system is safe for HST.",
    "Justification": "This is a very bright target for HST, close to the bright limit of COS (Cosmic Origins Spectrograph) and its observation with HST might be difficult. Therefore, photometric data is extremely helpful to understand if the system is safe for HST.",

    "Title": "Alert Notice 832: Monitoring of FO Aqr needed for HST observations",
    "Principal Investigator": "Dr. Peter Garnavich (Notre Dame University)",
    "Abstract": "Dr. Peter Garnavich requests AAVSO observers' assistance in monitoring the intermediate polar cataclysmic variable FO Aqr in support of spectroscopic observations with the Hubble Space Telescope scheduled for 2023 September 27 and 29. Calibrated CCD observations are requested beginning immediately and continuing through October 6.",
    "Justification": "FO Aqr is a bright 'intermediate polar' where a cool secondary star is donating mass to a rapidly spinning, magnetic white dwarf. The spinning white dwarf is seen as strong, 21-minute periodic pulses over the 4.85 hour binary orbital period. UV spectroscopy with HST was proposed to search for an outflow. As FO Aqr is known to be variable, NASA is requiring that FO Aqr be monitored for a week before the HST visit and that a confirmation of its brightness be made less than 24 hours before data-taking begins. Confirmation observations that show FO Aqr is below the brightness limit are required on the mornings of September 26 and September 28.",
