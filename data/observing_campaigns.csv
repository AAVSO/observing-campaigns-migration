The observations aim to study superhump behavior, which is not well understood in all classes of cataclysmic variables.|TT Ari exhibits occasional fadings of several magnitudes, from its usual high-state (maximum) magnitude of ~10.5V to a low-state magnitude as faint as 16V. These fadings occur every 20-25 years, and last between 500 and 1000 days. TT Ari exibits superhumps - both positive (the superhump period is longer than the orbital period) and negative (the superhump period is shorter than the orbital period). While positive superhumps are thought probably to be the result of an eccentric configuration in the accretion disk, the mechanism for negative superhumps is not yet understood. With the observations, the aim is to detect significant superhump period variations, as well as periodic signals in the range of several days.|TT Ari|2012-08-25|2012-10-20|Archived

With its accretion rate of 2.5 · 10−9 M⊙/yr in 2012 (Manara et al. 2022), HM Lup is among the strongest accretors in Lupus. The optical spectrum of HM Lup is rich in emission lines typical of a Classical T Tauri Star. Due to the accretion process, HM Lup is a very active star and it is both photometrically and spectroscopically variable.

Hα spectra of the star show double-peaked emission indicative of material in a circumstellar disk. The Hα emission was fairly consistent in observations from DDO and DAO in 1996 and 1997 as well as in spectra taken from WIRO in 2013 and 2014; the variability was minimal over timescales ranging from hours to years. This long-lived emission contrasts with well- studied emission from the Oe star ζ Oph where emission is more episodic. The most recent observations for VES 735 came in 2021 and 2022 from the DAO and Apache Point Observatory which showed the intensity of the Hα emission between 2 - 4 times the level of the stellar continuum. This is in strong contrast to the 1.1 - 1.5 times the continuum level that had been seen in the observations between 1996 and 2014. The goal is to arrange photometric observations to complement a new spectroscopic campaign at DAO this fall that determines if the emission has returned to its pre-outburst state or if the strong emission is still ongoing. The AAVSO observing campaign observations will allow us to see if there is a relationship between the star’s Hα brightness and the star’s V-band magnitude.|ASASSN-V J022007.17+610705.5|2022-10-13|N/A|Active
